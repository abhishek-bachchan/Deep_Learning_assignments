# Deep_Learning_assignments

#Contains assignments related to Deep Learning Models from Coursera.

#Differntiation between 2 layer Neural network and L layer Neural Network (where L>2) in terms of performance

#Also contains how tuning the hyperparameters effects the precision on Test Data set as well as avoid overfitting of Training Data Set

#Finally the model trained was applied on Data_set to classify images as Cat and Non-Cat.

#With Deep Neural network, efficiency was 80%. But tuning parameters increases  the efficieny to 85%
